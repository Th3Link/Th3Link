Making the [book shelf]({% post_url 2024-01-01-book-shelf-box %}) was a boost for my 
energy and motivation, bringing back the good old days' productivity vibes. My father 
made a toy shelf for my son more than a year ago and it's still lacking the storage 
boxes. So I decided to make three toy 
boxes myself. I got some 18mm beech wood from the hardware store (Bauhaus) and used 
my new table saw and router table.

I stuck to the same way of putting things together, using butt joints and dowels, 
and it turned out well in a decent amount of time. Making grip grooves and holes was 
tricky. I tried with a forstner bit, cut the rest with a jigsaw, and perfected it 
with a router template. I faced some challenges - my jigsaw took a fall during house 
construction, and the router bit didn't work well with a handheld router. After a few 
attempts, I got a new router bit and used the router table, realizing that nothing 
beats a sharp router bit. I applied one coat of hardwax oil as finish for all parts.

I couldn't resist engraving some cool designs on the front â€“ a steam engine for my 
son's curiosity and my love for engineering. My dad, a real engineer (not like me, 
a software engineer who thinks they can do everything), has his Duple toy railway in 
this box. The second box has Nessaja, a very old and very wise turtle, and a handsome
dragon named Tabaluga with his buddy Happy. It's a bit like Peter Pan's idea of not 
wanting to grow up, echoing my goal of staying young at heart.

The third box shows a whale lifted by balloons, with a saying:

> When dreams travel on the back of a whale across the sea, they become colorful 
  balloons in the sky of imagination.

> "That's All I Have To Say About That" - Forrest Gump

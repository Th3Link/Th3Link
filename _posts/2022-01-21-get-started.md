# Hello World
This blog was waiting a long time to get started. It was clear to me, that when I want
to write a blog one day, I don't want to struggle with web services etc. Now this
jekyll static page generator draw my attention and voila, after nearly two years
the blog is now online.

Now what can you expect to read here? 

I am a professional embedded software developer and an amateur level electronic engineer.
There are a lot of topics that I want to face in blog posts. I am also kind of new to 
embedded linux and hope
to get more experience and knowledge over the time. Writing about it might also help me
structure it and may also help you getting more into the embedded linux world.

In my basement is a lot of space for a woodworking shop, but currently, there is only
a huge mess beside some more or less helpful tools. The next task is to build a general
purpose workbench and after that a proper woodworking workbench that is also suitable
for hand woodwork.

As I already built a kitchen myself, the kitchen for the house is already in the making.
The cabinets are built three years ago and are still in a very raw state. Two cabinets,
who will form a kitchen island, already have drawers but there is still a lot to do.

Also an annoying issue is the heating system. We have a heat pump which is only in manual
operation mode since two years. When the temperature has to be adjusted, I need to go
down to the heating in the basement and make the changes there. I already added a eBUS interface that
uses (ebusd)[https://github.com/john30/ebusd], but it can only read out some values.
Maybe a control that is hooked in between the control panel and the heating system
is easier to realize.

Another project with a bit more fun is a music box for my son that uses RFID cards to
select a file to be played from SD card or network, similar to the 
(Tonuino)[https://www.voss.earth/tonuino/] but with some other features. It will be based
on a semi powerful ESP32 WROVER and the (Squeezelite)[https://github.com/sle118/squeezelite-esp32]
suite.

When the weather gets warmer I will be in the garden and work on converting some parts
from a green desert (meadow) to a permaculture food forest and a not so much permaculture
veggie garden. As I totally like collecting
things I already started collecting different kinds and varieties of berries which I
want to document where it is in the garden and how it is developing. Maybe the initial
start of an open source garden software can be made.

Finally, I am also a passionate beer brewer, currently brewing only a few times a year.
Software wise we are still on beersmith3 which is just too expensive for two or three
brewing sessions a year. I also want something that can use a git repository to store
the recipes. So I think of extending the (brewtarget)[http://www.brewtarget.org/] software.
I find using git repositories as data storage in combination with human readable file
formats are just superior in terms of availability, sharing data, version control and
easy to setup.

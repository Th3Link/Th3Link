The workshop is full of projects that I haven't finished yet. I really enjoy starting 
new projects and feeling the satisfaction of completing them, but I struggle to finish 
them all the way through.

Recently, my wife suggested we make a wall mirror together using oak wood planks and 
an affordable IKEA "LÃ„RBRO" mirror. During the summer, we split the planks and cut 
the angles for the mitre. I didn't have fancy tools like a table saw or router table, 
so I had some challenges in creating the perfect fit for the mirror. I also had no 
clue about how to secure the mirror or connect the boards.

As my unfinished projects piled up, and with the mirror being something we needed at 
home, I decided to tackle it again. I joined the boards using a simple butt joint and 
wood glue. Once that set, I created channels for reinforcement sticks using a router 
and the now-available table saw.

To hang the mirror on the wall, I drilled a 22mm hole with a forstner bit and 
designed a 3D-printed holder to screw in place. You can download the design files 
here; they're made using openscad, which is straightforward for me as a software 
developer. Alternatively, the holters can easily made out of round stock wood.

After sanding and applying two coats of hardwax oil, I finally mounted the mirror on 
the wall. It's securely held in place by two hooks on the top and one hook in the 
middle on the bottom. Now, our house feels complete with the addition of this DIY 
wall mirror.

In the aftermath of Christmas, I undertook a modest yet meaningful project - a 
custom book storage box for my son. His passion for books, particularly heightened 
during the holiday season, necessitated an organized solution. Thus, I fashioned a 
mobile bookshelf, imparting a touch of my personality through intricately laser-cut 
designs on the sturdy 18mm beech wood planks. I applied one coat of hardwax oil as 
finish for all parts.

The assembly is a simple yet effective butt-joint technique, firmly secured with 
dowels. The weighty nature of the 18mm beech wood ensures durability and stability, 
crucial for accommodating a growing collection of literary treasures. The addition of 
desk chair rollers, repurposed from an unused chair, brings an unexpected yet 
practical dimension. When the shelves are bare, my son revels in using the spacious 
compartment as a whimsical mobile seat, joyfully traversing the house.

The quote "Ein Buch ist wie ein Garten, den man in der Tasche tr√§gt" 
translates to "A book is like a garden that fits in your pocket" in English. Its is 
either a Chinese, African or Arabic prover. It conveys the idea that a book, like a 
garden, is a source of beauty, inspiration, and exploration that can be carried with 
you wherever you go. The quote highlights the portable and enriching nature of books.

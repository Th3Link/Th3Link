I'm in the process of rethinking my workshop layout due to an "unplanned" table saw 
workbench setup. The workshop spans about 40mÂ² and has a substantial 2.5m wide 
gateway leading to the garage. Towards the rear, there's the house's heating and hot 
water setup, alongside a storage spot for unused furniture. I'm planning to erect a 
wall to conceal this area while ensuring occasional access.

Most of my projects revolve around woodworking, but I occasionally have to do car 
repairs. Considering that I also want to get into metalworking, I'm earmarking space accordingly. 
Additionally, I aim to segregate the grinding and sanding zones to contain metal dust 
within a smaller designated area.

The Mitre Saw Station is already set up as a skeleton, housing the mitre saw and drill 
press. The edge belt sander is also in place but need dust collection. 
The table saw is also stationed here, but still a work in progress.

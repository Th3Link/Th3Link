The workshop in my basement is still a big "under construction area" as storage
capacity and machines are missing. As for the time of writing, there is a cabinet
for the mitre saw that I bought for building the house, an edge belt sander and
a planer/thickness planer as well as a dust collector that has almost no use as it
is not connected to anything.

I wanted to not have a table saw for a long time. A good one is expensive and even
then it is loud, dirty and dangerous. But its also verd useful for rip cuts. I also
miss a router table for my Triton TRA001 from the old shop. After these considerations
I decided to get a table saw, sold a lot of my old gaming stuff (Nintendo NES, SNES, Gameboy, etc)
and got enough money to get a table saw, saw blades and a table saw stand.



The stand is mainly motivated by [Paosons workbench](https://www.paoson.com/blog/en/mobile-workbench-with-table-saw-router-table-showcase/).
Its mainly laminated plywood that can be easily be build. My perfection on the joints
and exact measures of the parts could be better but it works.

A difficult part was to get the table straight. I used a straightedge and a hand plane
to true up the table as well as long bars to get the twist out. Finally, I CNC'd a hole
for the router insert into the table. The insert plate is from [Sautershop](https://www.sautershop.de/sauter-einlegeplatte-elp2.0-tri-mit-reduzierplatten-sa-elp2.0-tri?c=16146)
and seems a good upgrade from the Kregs plastic insert plate in my previous workshop.

There is still a lot to do, drawers, the sliding table plate, fixation of
the table saw, sliding rails, clamping rails, table saw sled and dust extraction needs
to be done.

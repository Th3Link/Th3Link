My basement workshop remains a work in progress, awaiting additional storage and 
machinery. At present, it houses a cabinet for the mitre saw initially bought for 
constructing the house, an edge belt sander, a planer/thickness planer, and an 
underutilized dust collector that's yet to be connected.

The decision to acquire a table saw was a long time coming. Despite being costly, 
noisy, messy, and potentially hazardous, its efficacy for rip cuts couldn't be overlooked. 
I found myself also longing for a router table for my trusty Triton TRA001 from my 
previous workshop. To fund this upgrade, I sold my collection of old gaming stuff 
(Nintendo NES, SNES, Gameboy, etc).



Inspired by [Paosons workbench](https://www.paoson.com/blog/en/mobile-workbench-with-table-saw-router-table-showcase/), 
I opted for a laminated plywood stand. While my precision in jointing and exact 
measurements might've room for improvement, the stand serves its purpose well.

Achieving a level table was a challenging task. I meticulously used a straightedge 
and hand plane, supplemented by long bars to eliminate any twists. CNC'ing a hole for 
the router insert was the final touch. In my old shop I had a plastic insert plate from
Kreg's which was also very decent, but this time I got an aluminium one from [Sautershop](https://www.sautershop.de/sauter-einlegeplatte-elp2.0-tri-mit-reduzierplatten-sa-elp2.0-tri?c=16146).

There's still much to accomplish - drawers, the sliding table plate, securing the table 
saw, installing sliding and clamping rails, crafting a table saw sled, and establishing 
an effective dust extraction system.
